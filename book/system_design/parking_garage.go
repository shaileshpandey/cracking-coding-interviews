// To manage a parking garage system in Go, we can start by defining the following classes/interfaces:

// Vehicle: This interface represents a generic vehicle. It can be implemented by different vehicle types such as Car, Motorcycle, Truck, etc.

// ParkingSpace: This struct represents a parking space in the garage. It contains information about the space, such as its ID, size, and occupancy status.

// ParkingFloor: This struct represents a floor in the parking garage. It contains a collection of ParkingSpace objects and manages the allocation of spaces to vehicles.

// ParkingGarage: This struct represents the entire parking garage. It contains a collection of ParkingFloor objects and manages the allocation of spaces across all floors.

// ParkingTicket: This struct represents a ticket issued to a driver upon entering the garage. It contains information such as entry time, vehicle information, assigned parking space, etc.

// Here's an example implementation with the primary methods and data for each class:

package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

// Vehicle interface represents a generic vehicle
type Vehicle interface {
	GetLicensePlate() string
}

// ParkingSpace represents a parking space in the garage
type ParkingSpace struct {
	ID       int
	Occupied bool
	Occupant Vehicle
}

// ParkingFloor represents a floor in the parking garage
type ParkingFloor struct {
	Spaces []ParkingSpace
}

// ParkingGarage represents the entire parking garage
type ParkingGarage struct {
	Floors []ParkingFloor
}

// ParkingTicket represents a ticket issued to a driver upon entering the garage
type ParkingTicket struct {
	EntryTime time.Time
	Vehicle   Vehicle
}

// Car struct represents a car
type Car struct {
	LicensePlate string
}

// GetLicensePlate returns the license plate of the car
func (c Car) GetLicensePlate() string {
	return c.LicensePlate
}

// Motorcycle struct represents a motorcycle
type Motorcycle struct {
	LicensePlate string
}

// GetLicensePlate returns the license plate of the motorcycle
func (m Motorcycle) GetLicensePlate() string {
	return m.LicensePlate
}

// ParkVehicle assigns a parking space to a vehicle
func (pg *ParkingGarage) ParkVehicle(vehicle Vehicle) error {
	for _, floor := range pg.Floors {
		for i, space := range floor.Spaces {
			if !space.Occupied {
				floor.Spaces[i].Occupied = true
				floor.Spaces[i].Occupant = vehicle
				fmt.Printf("Vehicle with license plate %s parked at space %d on floor %d\n", vehicle.GetLicensePlate(), space.ID, i+1)
				return nil
			}
		}
	}
	return fmt.Errorf("no available parking space")
}

// Initialize parking garage with floors and spaces
func initializeParkingGarage(numFloors, numSpacesPerFloor int) *ParkingGarage {
	garage := &ParkingGarage{}
	for i := 0; i < numFloors; i++ {
		floor := ParkingFloor{}
		for j := 0; j < numSpacesPerFloor; j++ {
			space := ParkingSpace{
				ID: j + 1,
			}
			floor.Spaces = append(floor.Spaces, space)
		}
		garage.Floors = append(garage.Floors, floor)
	}
	return garage
}

// func main() {
// 	// Initialize parking garage with 3 floors and 10 spaces per floor
// 	garage := initializeParkingGarage(3, 10)

// 	// Create vehicles
// 	car1 := Car{LicensePlate: "ABC123"}
// 	motorcycle1 := Motorcycle{LicensePlate: "XYZ789"}

// 	// Park vehicles
// 	garage.ParkVehicle(car1)
// 	garage.ParkVehicle(motorcycle1)
// }

// In this implementation:

// Vehicle is an interface that represents a generic vehicle. It has one method GetLicensePlate() to get the license plate of the vehicle.
// ParkingSpace represents a parking space in the garage. It contains an ID, occupancy status, and information about the vehicle occupying the space.
// ParkingFloor represents a floor in the parking garage. It contains a collection of ParkingSpace objects.
// ParkingGarage represents the entire parking garage. It contains a collection of ParkingFloor objects.
// ParkingTicket represents a ticket issued to a driver upon entering the garage. It contains information such as entry time and the vehicle.
// Car and Motorcycle are concrete implementations of the Vehicle interface.
// ParkVehicle() method in ParkingGarage is responsible for assigning a parking space to a vehicle.
// initializeParkingGarage() function initializes the parking garage with the specified number of floors and spaces per floor.
// The primary data structure inside the program is a collection of nested slices representing the parking garage hierarchy. The ParkingGarage struct contains a slice of ParkingFloor structs, each of which contains a slice of ParkingSpace structs.

// For data storage, this program uses in-memory data structures (slices and structs) to represent the parking garage, floors, spaces, and vehicles. If persistence is required, the data could be stored in a database, with tables representing the garage, floors, spaces, and vehicles, and appropriate relationships between them.
